# Work to be Completed

The following tasks remain to be completed, but this list is not exhaustive:

- **QuoteEntryComponent:** Implement Reactive Forms for the following tabs:
  - "General Information"
  - "Items/Service"

**Note:** Challenges have been encountered in implementing Reactive Forms for the QuoteEntryComponent due to forms spanning multiple tabs within this component. Implementing a Reactive Form in one tab has caused rendering issues in other tabs, which have yet to be resolved.

- **QuoteEntryComponent:** Ensure data in the "Notes" tab is saved to the associated quote when the "Save" button is selected.
- **QuoteEntryComponent:** Implement functionality for the "Previews" tab.
- **Styling:** Align table headings with the data in the Quote List and Transaction List.
- **Kendo UI:** Apply Kendo UI window pop-ups as services for the following components:
  - QuoteEntryComponent
  - CreateTransactionsEntryComponent
  - TransactionEntryComponent
  - BulkTransactionEntryComponent
- **Component Merging:** Merge the following components into a single component:

  - CreateTransactionsEntryComponent
  - TransactionEntryComponent
  - BulkTransactionEntryComponent

- **Additional Features:**
  - Implement more sections accessible from other links in the side drawer.
  - Establish a connection to the backend database.
  - Implement visibility rights for departments, product types, etc., based on the logged-in user.

# Additional Information

- The bulk transaction upload feature via the upload/drag & drop function of the CreateTransactionsEntryComponent is designed to work correctly only with the BulkTransactions.xlsx template. Template file path: `src\app\transaction\BulkTransactions.xlsx`

# Technical Information

## IDE

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) version 1.92.0 x64

## Front End

- **Framework:** [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.2
- **Components Library:** [Kendo Angular UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/)
- **CSS Library:** [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) version 5.3.2

## Development Server

- Run `ng serve` to start a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if any source files are changed.

## Code Scaffolding

- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

- Run `ng test` to execute unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

- Run `ng e2e` to execute end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further Help

- For more assistance with Angular CLI, use `ng help` or visit the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
